
The variables in the files are defined as follows

meanSigku= Binned average Ku Sigma0 measurements [WS X Chi X beam], in dB
meanSigka= Binned average Ka Sigma0 measurements [WS X Chi X beam], in dB

stdSigku/ka =  corresponding binned std (in ratio)
nku/ka =  corresponding number of 0.5 deg boxes (all measurements inside a box were averaged) in the bin
mean_eia_ku/ka = Averatge earth incidence angle for beam 49 positions at Ku and Ka band respectively

a0 = A0 coeff at Ku band [WS X beam], in dB
	a01-a04 = polinomial coefficients to fit A0 for beams 1-25, in dB
a1 = A1 coeff at Ku band [WS X beam], in dB
	a11-a14 = polinomial coefficients to fit A0 for beams 1-25, in dB
a2 = A2 coeff at Ku band [WS X beam], in dB
	a21-a28 = polinomial coefficients to fit A0 for beams 1-25, in dB


c0 = A0 coeff at Ka band  [WS X beam], in dB
	c01-c04 = polinomial coefficients to fit A0 for beams 1-25, in dB
c1 = A1 coeff at Ka band [WS X beam], in dB
	c11-c14 = polinomial coefficients to fit A0 for beams 1-25, in dB
a2 = A2 coeff at Ka band [WS X beam], in dB
	c21-c28 = polinomial coefficients to fit A0 for beams 1-25, in dB

A0_Ku_SST = SST dependent A0 coeff at Ku band [SST X WS X Beam], in ratio
A0_Ka_SST = SST dependent A0 coeff at Ka band [SST X WS X Beam], in ratio

Wku = SST correction factor for Ku band
Wka = SST correction factor for Ka band
